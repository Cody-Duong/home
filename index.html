    <p>
	  Hey welcome to my website. It's currently under construction with a barebones HTML framework.
	  I wasn't too happy with the cookie-cutter templates that while understandable to someone who
	  codes mostly Java/LUA, it was still horrendous not having some of the customizable freedom.
	  Which is why I'm learning HTML, CSS, and SASS to utilize Jekyll to build my website. Unfortunately
	  this means it presently looks like it is straight from the 2000s. But all my relevant and
	  important information remains, so I'm not sure I really care. <br>
	  <a href="https://codyduong.github.io/resume/">Click here for a cookiecutter website I had.</a><br>
	  It should be noted that was basically created just from a template, editing a yml, and as such it
	  may contain verbose or irrelevant information, presented in a poorer format than a 2000 era document here.
	  That is however, my opinion, so feel free to navigate to there and look around for all the
	  nothingness contained there, I don't really plan on updating it. If the link doesn't work. Oops,
      I might've shut down the deployment. <br>
	  An aside to all that: No, I'm not a frontend developer. That's why my website looks like this.

	  The portfolio contains only snippets of my artwork. 
	  Please go to my github at <a href="https://github.com/codyduong">codyduong</a> for
	  code snippets. Unfortunately a lot of that code is stored in private repositories due to
	  my contractual obligations with my clients. Feel free to ask what I'm capable of in LUA/Java.
    </p>
    <p>	
	  I am mostly familiar with Roblox's LUA which utilizes a modified version of LUA 5.3. 
	  I am less familiar with LUA's features with server/client manipulation, as Roblox explicitly disables it for
	  security purposes. Otherwise, provided some time on a new LUA enviornment in a different game,
	  I can script with full comprehensiveness of the LUA program, especially in Roblox. <br>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Plugin creation with ModuleScripts</li>
		<li>Efficient code usage w/ ModuleScripts (ie. abstractization in LUA)</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>^ typically niche in smaller or games which utilize only one place</li></ul>
		<li>Picking up/Dropping Parts, with Tweening/Animation and Clientside Optimization</li>
		<li>Verifying Events with Server Checks</li>
		<li>UI Design</li>
		<li>Multiplace Games</li>
		<li>I do not do rigging/animating. I can do logic for hooking with those libraries however</li>
      </ul>
	</p>
    <p>Feel free to request a demo video/code snippet of any of the above. I also offer coding assistance
	to aspiring devs</p>
    <p>
	  My Java experience is mediocre at best. If you are here for commissioned work, you probably 
	  arrived for LUA in Roblox. Hopefully soon I'll use LibGDX's HTML implementation to embed some cool
	  things on this website. But firstly, I need to you know, make this website better. Eventually...
