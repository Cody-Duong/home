# artNCode
a testing website

It's called artNCode so GithubPages will direct users to my website.url/artNcode

Honestly, wasn't too happy with whatever was going on with all the template websites, so I'm learning HTML and Jekyll and doing it myself.

Maybe, whenever this project gets complete enough, someone will want to fork it. Until then, don't expect to gain too much from this aside from a 2000 era website.
