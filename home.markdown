Welcome. Here I host my personal and professional work. I'm a self-taught programmer and
a 3D Printing, Digital Art, and 3D modelling hobbyist.


I hodge-podged this website together using Jekyll and my limited knowledge of HTML, JS, and CSS.
Something is probably broken...

<u>This website is still under construction.</u>

Enjoy your stay.
