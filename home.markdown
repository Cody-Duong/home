Welcome. Here I host my personal and professional work. I'm a self-taught programmer and
a 3D Printing, Digital Art, and 3D modelling hobbyist.


I hodge-podged this website together using Jekyll with React put in using Webpack. Please
don't ask me, it was painful and I'm and idiot.

<u>This website is still under construction.</u>

Enjoy your stay.
